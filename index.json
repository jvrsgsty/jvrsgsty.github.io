Limit Cycles  In a vicinity of a critical point, the weights do not present Brownian motion, rather they have a deterministic component generating loops in weight space. Relevant observables shown:  Eigenvalue spectra of covariance matrices over time (does not change much), along with mean and std of eigenvalues, as well as rank. These quantities inform the performance of a given architecture on a dataset. Fast Fourier Transform of weights over time (should be constant in Brownian motion case). Auto-correlation of weights (should quickly decay to zero in Brownian motion case). Dimension-normalized gradient norm: they observe it does not decrease wrt the number of epochs and even shows a growing trend. This is justified by the presence of a non-zero force $j(x)$ which is responsible for theobserved Fourier harmonics.

Further, if the loss function is interpreted as a log-posterior and make the goal to approximate the posterior as well as possible (in terms of KL divergence), the authors derive optimal hyperparameters. 4 key assumptions:  The gradient noise is Gaussian The weight estimates are constrained to a small enough region of parameter space that the sampling noise covariance of the stochastic gradients is constant. The step size is small enough that the discrete Markov Process can be approximated by a continuous time Markov process. Lastly, the stationary distribution of the process has a closed form solution if we assume we can approximate the loss as a quadratic bowl (we are close to a local minima).   The authors show how this SDE view is related to stochastic gradient Fisher scoring. The main practical contribution, is that this view provides a way to compute mathematically optimal hyperparameters for a small amount if data, in contrast to the computational burden of cross-validating parameters.

Comments   The theory shown does not seem to consider the role of the batch size in the stochasticity of the training process.\n  The authors\u0026rsquo; discussion on the Linear Scaling Principle (rescaling the learning rate with the batch size) is not entirely clear to me. It seems the main takeaway is that when rescaling the LR by a factor of $k$ to use a batch size that is $k$ times larger, then the angular update is affected mainly by the change in the rescaling of the LR (which scales with $\\sqrt k$).\n The authors compare the angular update between $w_t$ and $w_{t+1}$ for the larger batch size against the cumulative angular update over $k$ steps for the smaller batch. We interpret this to mean the angular update between $w_t$ and $w_{t+k}$, since we cannot say anything about the additivity of the angular updates. The cummulative angular update for small batch is larger than the single step angular update for larger batch size.

Until recently, attempts to create local learning rules that avoid weight transport have typically failed in the large-scale learning scenarios where backpropagation shines, e.g. ImageNet categorization with deep convolutional networks. Here, we investigate a recently proposed local learning rule that yields competitive performance with backpropagation and find that it is highly sensitive to metaparameter choices, requiring laborious tuning that does not transfer across network architecture. Our analysis indicates the underlying mathematical reason for this instability, allowing us to identify a more robust local learning rule that better transfers without metaparameter tuning. Nonetheless, we find a performance and stability gap between this local rule and backpropagation that widens with increasing model depth. We then investigate several non-local learning rules that relax the need for instantaneous weight transport into a more biologically-plausible 'weight estimation' process, showing that these rules match state-of-the-art performance on deep networks and operate effectively in the presence of noisy updates. Taken together, our results suggest two routes towards the discovery of neural implementations for credit assignment without weight symmetry: further improvement of local rules so that they perform consistently across architectures and the identification of biological implementations for non-local learning mechanisms.","tags":["ICML","Learning Rules","Deep Learning"],"title":"Two Routes to Scalable Credit Assignment without Weight Symmetry","type":"publication"}]
